a user can join, leave, and join again a group.

If access restricted:
1 = want to join the group but not yet accepted or not
2 = not accepted/refused
3 = banned of the group
4 = accepted

If access not restricted:
3 = banned of the group
4 = accepted

--> automatically accepted (4) because free access. no value 1 or 2.
